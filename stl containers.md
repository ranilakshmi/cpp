# STL CONTAINER

Containers stores a collection of objects.

## Sequential Containers
Containers whose contents can be accessed sequentially

 - Array
 - Vector
 - List
 - Dequeue

## Associative Containers

Implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).

 - Map
 - Set

## UnOrdered Associative Containers

Unordered associative containers implement unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be quickly searched (O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case complexity).

 - UnOrdered Map
 - UnOrdered Set

## Container Adapters

Container adaptors provide a different interface for sequential containers.

 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Priority queue
